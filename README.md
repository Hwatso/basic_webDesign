# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Computer languages for web development includes a variety of types, the most commonly used and heard are HTML, CSS and JS. 
People tend to learn these three languagues due to their simplicity and straight-forward meanings that do not need
prerequisite background knowledge.

## Editor, Compiler, IDE
As you start to dive into the new area of computer language, you might see these new terms. The commonly seen software Visual Studio Code, do you know which type of development it is?

- :sparkles: Editor. 

    In general, an editor refers to any program capable of editing files. Image editor, sound editor, text editor. 

    *VS Code can edit texts and codes, that's why we can see all these paragraphs in md file, so its function is included as editor.*

- :sparkles: Compiler. 

    A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytcode, or other programming languages that do good for computer but not human. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++. 

    *If you did use VS Code before, you must notice the extensions installed for different computer languages, which provide debuggers, tools to support devlopment workflow. It is not a compiler, but with support for many programming languages and frameworks. This unique feature is due to its architecture about modular extension system, allowing developers to create and publish extensions that add support for specific language, framework, and tool.* 

- :sparkles: IDE. 

    Stands for Integrated Dvelopment Environment. The main idea is that IDE makes code easier to write by applying syntax highlighting, code completion, and so on; easier to test by using debugger and being able to inspect vairables and memories. IDE typically contains code editor, debugger, compiler, and other tools for building, testing, and deploying software. 

    *Strictly speaking, VS Code is not an IDE because its primary goal is to design a lightweight, flexible code editor that can be customized to suit different programming languages and environments. An professional and full-fledged IDE would be more complex and integrated with features.*

## Language, Library, Framework
Sometimes, you might hear about React, Vue, Django, but they are not languages. What are they? Or when you are using MATLAB for school work, what does the library Numpy actually do?

- :sparkles: Language:

    A set of rules, syntax, and semantics that define the structure of code used to communicate instructions with a computer. It allows developers to create software, application, and system.

- :sparkles: Library:

    A collection of pre-written code that can be reused to perform specific functions in a software application. It usually contains a set of pre-built functions or methods that can be called by a program. You would save time by not writing the same code over and over again and be able to reuse them in whatever new programs.

- :sparkles: Framework:

    A pre-built software platform that provides a structured set of tools and libraries for building software applications. Frameworks typically provide a set of pre-defined patterns and structures for organizing code, as well as a range of libraries and utilities for performing common tasks. So, framework is a comprehensive development environment with tools and libraries that everything is prepared (relatively) for organizing code and building applications.

In this post, I have summarized my personal learning experience of HTML and CSS, and I'm on the way learning JS.
There are a bunch of online open resources that amazingly explained the scenarios and conditions to use certain kinds of HTML elements and tags, or revealed the trick to fulfill the task. I would list the links below.

## My Personal Project
It might not be real project but... I tried on my own to mimick xiaomi shopping website to test my skills to write a complete webpage, the file can be seen in [xiaomi-website-mock](./xiaomi-website-mock/) folder (open xiaomi.html file).
