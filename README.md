## HTML
1. notice how HTMLs are usually written. from top to bottom, from left to right. wisely use **div** to seperate areas. 

## CSS
### tricks
1. use **float** property to easily align elements, or overlap two region blocks; width and height can be used in FLOAT. after, BLOCKs can use **clean:both** to cancel the float elements both up and down.
2. create seperated files to store all css, including general css that applied to all HTMLs. split two windows.
3. if you have a long picture, try using **background-position** and **@keyframes** to move picture and make animation.
