# A Concept about Self-Discipline App
**2023.1**
This was an early work of me when I just learnt HTML and CSS (without JavaScript) and attended DeltaHacks9 Hackathon. <br>
The topic was about creating something to help people with a healthier life, which made me think of an app to help keep track and be reminder of good sleep schedule, enough exercise, proper planning for todos, and healthy diet everyday. I did not know other proper app programming language so I used HTML and CSS to describe its functionality. <br>
"forum.html", "Home.html", "memo-gallery.html" were the files I made during competition, they were not interactive and lacked the "health.html" page at that moment, but I still liked the style and I completed that page later. <br>
